# ShowdownBotClient

Small pet project to learn Kotlin and better understand project deployment, dependencies and anything I might need and am not comfortable with as of the start of the project.

The project itself aims at building a custom client to the https://pokemonshowdown.com/ Pokemon battle simulator.

The first step is to connect to it with the help of the Ktor framework, and then exchange messages in order to be able to start a battle and see the end of it (choosing random or default actions to keep it simple).

At this point I hope the be more familiar with Kotlin and the second step will be to create a real strategy that actually tries to win. The first idea that comes across is a Minmax algorithm, but I'll see when I get there.
